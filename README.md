Introduction

 Exploring and understanding the Seattle rental market for the
 first time. I do not have previous knowledge of Seattle so this is the
 first cast to understand the rental market.   Addiitonally, I have
 been  focusing on modeling.  therefore, I decided  to take an
 analysis approach instead to enhance  these skills.  Udacity Data
 Science  projects. AirBNB is located in San Francisco, Californai an 
 was founded 2008.
..
Data files provided in Seattle AirBnB database

Calendar.csv  - contains listings, dates, daily prices.  
          
Listings.csv  -	contains , listings, name of the listing, weekly and monthly prices, number 
of reviews per months and other features.	

Reviews.csv	-  contains listings, reviews, dates for the review, and who provided the 
review.
Data understanding

The data covers 3,818 listings on AirBnB in Seattle. It provides information on home features, review scores and their availability.
It also provides information of prices, monthly for long term rentals, weekly prices and daily prices for short term rentals.

I wanted better understanding of the pricing, to investigate most popular listings and their prices and if there where any reviews and rate of occupancy.  Some of the questions that I have analyzed are
i.	How popular is Seattle rental market?
ii.	Top listings with number of reviews weekly, monthly and daily prices
iii.	To understand short term rental pricing and the variety of it.

These results could be used for recommendations for users to find proper housing to rent for their needs and used as a guideline for renting own housing. When investigating prices it should noted that monthly, weekly and daily prices should be dealt separately with due to number of different daily prices per housing,


How Popular is the Seattle?

Occupancy rate in Seattle is almost 80 procent which seems to be quite good rate. Therefore, 
it should be easy to get tenants to a housing in Seattle and also easy to find a place to stay.
 The Figure below shows top 10 listings in Seattle.





	Figure above shows that  several  listings has different daily prices and number of dates they 
	are valid. Additionally, availability of each listing per price.


What is the distribution of the Daily prices?



Some of housing seems to be available only short term rental due to only daily prices are 
listed in database. Most of the housing is in the daily price category up to 200 dollars. 
Many of the housing has several daily prices depending of the time of the yea. Even though 
the most popular housings seem to have only one daily price all around the year.

What is the distribution of the weekly prices?





 Most of the housing is in the weekly price category up to 1000 dollars. The most common 
weekly price is slightly below 1000 dollars.

Next, if prediction of the prices is of interest they should be made for each price category
 separately.

What is the distribution of the monthly prices?




Most of the housing is in the weekly price category is around 2500 dollars. 
Other Findings


What I found strange was that the most top listing was childrens hospital in Seattle. You are 
not expecting to find this kind of property in AirBnB listings.
